What things you need to install the software and how to install them

## First: Install all packages

(this includes node packages and mongoose.)
Just run npm install in this repositories's terminal.

```sh
npm install
```

## Install nodemon to run the app

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
Just use nodemon instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes.

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
```
